# Layout Pattern Analysis for Phone Frame Containment

## Current Issue
The UpcomingStationSelector component has a footer button breaking out of the phone frame bounds due to using fixed positioning without proper containment.

## Component Layout Patterns

### Working Patterns

1. ScheduleView (Best Practice)
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col h-full bg-white relative">
  {/* Fixed header */}
  <div className="bg-[#0B4EA2] text-white p-4">...</div>
  
  {/* Scrollable content */}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">...</div>
  
  {/* Footer with proper containment */}
  <div className="px-4 pb-8 pt-4 bg-white border-t">...</div>
</div>
```
- Uses relative positioning on parent
- Proper flex column layout
- Scrollable area with flex-1
- Footer stays within bounds using standard flow

2. RouteSelector
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-white">
  <div className="bg-[#0B4EA2] text-white p-4">...</div>
  <div className="flex-1 bg-gray-50 overflow-y-auto pb-20">...</div>
  <div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4">...</div>
</div>
```
- Similar pattern but uses fixed positioning for floating action button
- Adds padding-bottom to scrollable area to prevent content overlap

### Problematic Patterns

1. UpcomingStationSelector (Current Issue)
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col h-full">
  <div className="flex-shrink-0">...</div>
  <div className="flex-1 min-h-0">...</div>
  <div className="flex-shrink-0 px-4 pb-8 pt-4">...</div>
</div>
```
- Lacks proper overflow containment
- Footer positioning breaks phone frame bounds
- Missing background colors for visual containment

2. StationSelector
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-white">
  ...
  <div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4">...</div>
</div>
```
- Similar issues with fixed positioning
- Could benefit from the ScheduleView pattern

## Key Findings

1. Container Structure
- Best: `flex flex-col h-full bg-white relative`
- Ensures proper height containment
- Enables relative positioning context
- Provides visual background containment

2. Scrollable Content
- Best: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`
- Use padding-bottom when needed for floating elements
- Avoid min-h-0 as it can break containment

3. Footer Positioning
- Best: Standard flow with `border-t` and padding
- Alternative: Sticky positioning with proper containment
- Avoid: Fixed positioning unless absolutely necessary

4. Visual Containment
- Always include background colors
- Use border-t for visual separation
- Consider shadow or border for floating elements

### Changes Made
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col h-full bg-white relative">
  {/* Header */}
  <div className="bg-[#0B4EA2] text-white p-4">...</div>
  
  {/* Scrollable Content */}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto pb-20">...</div>
  
  {/* Footer */}
  <div className="bg-white border-t border-gray-200 sticky bottom-0">
    <div className="px-4 py-4 flex justify-end">
      <button className="w-14 h-14 rounded-full bg-[#0B4EA2] text-white flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg hover:bg-[#0A4589]">
        <Search size={24} />
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Analysis of Failure
1. Adding `relative` to root container did not establish proper containment
2. `pb-20` padding in scrollable area was insufficient
3. `sticky` positioning on footer still allowed button to break containment
4. Visual improvements (hover state) were added but did not address core containment issue

### Solution Found
The issue was resolved by adding `[transform-style:preserve-3d]` to the PhoneFrame's screen content container. This works because:

1. Fixed positioning in CSS positions elements relative to their containing block
2. By default, fixed elements are positioned relative to the viewport
3. However, certain CSS properties can create a new containing block for fixed elements:
   - transform
   - perspective
   - filter
   - contain: paint
   - will-change: transform/perspective/filter
   - transform-style: preserve-3d

By adding `transform-style: preserve-3d` to the PhoneFrame's screen content, we created a new containing block that constrains the fixed search button within the phone frame bounds. This is why the search button in UpcomingRouteSelector was properly contained - it was being positioned relative to the phone frame rather than the viewport.

## Implementation Notes

1. Always use the PhoneFrame component's constraints:
   - Width: w-[390px]
   - Height: h-[800px]
   - Rounded corners: rounded-[2.5rem]

2. Overflow handling:
   - Parent: overflow-hidden
   - Content: overflow-y-auto

3. Visual hierarchy:
   - Use background colors for all sections
   - Include proper spacing and borders
   - Consider z-index for overlapping elements

4. Mobile considerations:
   - Account for notch and home indicator
   - Consider safe areas
   - Test touch interactions
